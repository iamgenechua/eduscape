## Playing

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/eduscapevr/eduscape/releases) for Oculus Quest or Oculus Rift.
For the Quest, you will need [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-adb/)
and will have to follow the instructions below:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your computer. Navigate to the directory where ADB is installed.
2. Connect your Oculus Quest. You will need it to be in [Developer mode](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/).
3. Check that the Quest is detected by running the command `adb devices`. If you see that the device is "unauthorized", put on the headset and click "Allow" in the popup that appears.
4. Install Eduscape.apk from the latest release onto the Quest by running the command `adb install path/to/Eduscape.apk`
5. In your Oculus device, go to the Apps menu, select Unknown Sources, and click on Eduscape to begin the game.

On the Quest, the game might take up to 30 seconds to load.

## Building

**Required**:
- Unity
- VR Device

Eduscape was developed and tested on an *Oculus Quest*.
The instructions below include steps for the Oculus Rift, but we cannot guarantee they work.
Instructions for other headsets such as the HTC Vive are not provided, but the project should be buildable regardless of the VR device chosen.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Add the root directory of the project to Unity Hub and open the project.
3. To see the scene, double-click the `SampleScene.unity` file in the Scenes folder in the project window in Unity.
4. In Unity, go to `File > Build Settings`.
5. Ensure `Scenes/SampleScene` is *checked* and `Scenes/Main Menu` is *unchecked*.
6. If you are building for Oculus Quest:
   - Switch to the `Android` platform
   - Connect your Oculus Quest and select it as the `Run Device`
   - Press `Build and Run`
7. If you are building for Oculus Rift:
   - Ensure the `PC, Mac & Linux Standalone` platform is selected
   - Press `Build and Run`

### Planned Features

There is great potential for Eduscape in becoming a widely-used VR tool in education.

- Timer to simulate actual escape rooms
- Develop VR curriculum for more Physics topics (eg. Newtonian Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism)
